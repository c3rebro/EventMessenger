<h1>Additional Setup - Create a new Bot with Telegram</h1>
<p>
Prior sending messages from the eventmessenger to your mobile device, you need 
to:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Of course install the Telegram App from your preferred App Store. The 
	Telegram App is available within IOS, Android and WindowsPhone stores.</li>
	<li>Add a bot to your contact list.<br />
	A Bot is a computer program that shows up like a normal user within your 
	contact list. It will send you messages and is the interface between the 
	EventMessenger and your mobile device.</li>
</ol>
<p>
This example covers the process on an android os mobile device. However the 
procedure should be analogue on other devices. Start by searching the Telegram 
App in your preferred App Store.<br />
<br />
<span class="auto-style1">
<img alt="" height="500" src="TelegramInstallPlayStore.png" width="264" /></span></p>
<p>
Start the App.<br />
<br />
<span class="auto-style1">
<img alt="" height="500" src="AndoidHomeAfterTelegramInstalled.png" width="265" /></span></p>
<p>
And begin the configuration.</p>
<p>
<span class="auto-style1">
<img alt="" height="499" src="TelegramBeginConfig.png" width="268" /></span></p>
<p>
Telegram links his services to your mobile device by using its mobile number. 
For authentication purpose Telegram wants to get access to various ressources of 
your device. Primarily these are taking calls and reading sms mails.<br />
<br />
<span class="auto-style1">
<img alt="" height="499" src="TelegramPleaseAllowAccess.png" width="262" /></span></p>
<p>
Please give access to your sms and phone calls<br />
<br />
<span class="auto-style1">
<img alt="" height="500" src="imgD.jpg" width="265" /></span></p>
<p>
Please provide your mobile number without preceding '0'. That said, change "0172 123456" 
to "172 123456"<br />
<br />
<span class="auto-style1">
<img alt="" height="500" src="InsertTelephoneNumber.png" width="257" /></span></p>
<p>
Telegram will validate your information by giving a call to the number you 
provided.<br />
<br />
<span class="auto-style1">
<img alt="" height="499" src="WaitForSMS.png" width="267" /></span></p>
<p>
After a successful validation, Telegram will ask for additional access rights. 
These are not mandatory as long as you just use Telegram in conjunction with 
EventMessenger. If you instead would use the App and all of its features you 
need to allow access to your contact list, media and so on.<br />
<br />
<span class="auto-style1">
<img alt="" height="500" src="img1B.jpg" width="262" /></span></p>
<p>
After the first time setup is done, you will see a blank screen.<br />
<br />
<span class="auto-style1">
<img alt="" height="500" src="img1E.jpg" width="259" /></span></p>
<p>
You can now start searching your contact list if anybody else is using telegram 
or proceed to create a new bot. In case of the latter, we will add a special 
contact to our contact list. This contact is a Telegram built-in service called 
"botfather". "botfather" will create your bot.<br />
<br />
In order to start talking to "botfather" open your preferred mobile browser and 
browse to: telegram.me/botfather.<br />
<br />
<span class="auto-style1">
<img alt="" height="500" src="BrowserBotfatherURL.png" width="260" /></span></p>
<p>
You will see the homepage of the service. Please add the "Botfather" to your 
Telegram contact list by clicking "Send Message".<br />
<br />
<span class="auto-style1">
<img alt="" height="499" src="img24.jpg" width="254" /></span></p>
<p>
After Telegram has been shown up, start a new conversion with the "botfather" by 
clicking the "Start" button below.<br />
<br />
<span class="auto-style1">
<img alt="" height="501" src="img29.jpg" width="262" /></span></p>
<p>
"Botfather" will provide some possible commands to choose from. Please select 
the "/newbot" command.<br />
After we did this, "botfather" should ask you to provide a display name for the 
new bot.<br />
<br />
<span class="auto-style1">
<img alt="" height="499" src="img2D.jpg" width="266" /></span></p>
<p>
After that, we provide a username for the bot which is basically the same like 
the displayname except it must end with the phrase "bot"<br />
<br />
Example:<br />
<br />
Display Name: EventMessenger<br />
User Name: EventMessengerBot<br />
<br />
<span class="auto-style1">
<img alt="" height="499" src="img31.jpg" width="264" /></span></p>
<p>
In the end, "Botfather" will provide the access token that will be used by the 
EventMessenger.<br />
<br />
<span class="auto-style1">
<img alt="" height="500" src="img32.jpg" width="265" /></span></p>
<p>
Please use your favorite way to transfer the token from your mobile device to 
the location where EventMessenger is installed.<br />
<br />
<span class="auto-style1">
<img alt="" height="500" src="img34.jpg" width="267" /></span></p>
<p>
Please continue by adding the token to the
<a href="CreateResponses_TelegramResponseAddBot.html">"Add Bot" Configuration 
Dialogue</a>.<br />
