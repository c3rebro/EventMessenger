<h1>Create Events - Door Monitoring Event</h1>
<p>
<img alt="" src="img17.jpg" />&nbsp;</p>
<p>In order to trigger an doormonitoring event, the EventMessenger software needs the 
name and serial number informations of the lock that has fired the 
doormonitoring event along with the desired type of doormonitoring event (e.g. 
"door has been opend"; "closed"; "locked" "secured" and others).&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Please follow these steps to create such setup:</p>
<ol>
	<li>&nbsp;Please begin by adding one or more locks.<ol>
		<li>Check the "consider lockname and/or serialnumber (phi)" checkbox if 
		you would like to apply a filter to this event. Otherwise, every 
		lockname or phi will be recognised regardless its name or phi.</li>
		<li>Define the name and/or phi of the lock of which you would like to be 
		informed about an unlocking event.<br />
		<br />
		HINT:<br />
		- your input is treated as case insensitive and as a part of a whole 
		search phrase<br />
		<br />
		Example:<br />
		If you have entered "entrance" as the name of the lock all of the 
		following locknames will return a positive match:<br />
		"main entrance"; "Entrance North"</li>
		<li>Please select a desired "doormonitoring type". You could add more 
		that one type by repeating steps 3 and 4.<br />
		</li>
		<li>Click on "Add" to add the lock with its name and phi (if defined 
		any) and your desired monitoring type.</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
	<li>Click on "OK" to finish your setup.</li>
</ol>
