<h1>Main Window - Debug Console</h1>
<p><img alt="" src="img1B1.jpg" /></p>
<p>The Debug Console could be used to generate virtual locking system events 
without having a real setup. Thus, giving the ability to the user to validate 
the project setup within the EventMessenger application.</p>
<p>The EventMessenger is capable of handling three different types of locking 
system events:</p>
<ul>
	<li>"Unlocking Events"<ul>
		<li>A transponder has been used on a lock with a "WaveNet" connection to 
		the LSM.Basic.Online Software. This could be either result in an "access 
		granted" or "access denied" by the lock. The virtual transponder and 
		lock will always have a fixed name and serial number.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>"Input Events"<ul>
		<li>A "WaveNetManager RouterNode with IO functions" has three physical 
		inputs. The EventMessenger software could be used to determine if there 
		were changes on the potentials of these inputs. </li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>"Door Monitoring Events"<ul>
		<li>A special kind of SimonsVoss Lock called "DoorMonitoring Lock" has 
		abilities to determine if there were chages on the doorstatus itself. 
		That means the Lock could inform wether the door is in an opened, closed 
		or locked state.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p><img alt="" height="32" src="276px-Ambox_warning_pn.svg.png" width="40" /> BE 
AWARE: The EventMessenger won't be able to retrieve events from the Locking 
Management System Software as long as the Console Window will be opened at 
application start. Please disable the console and restart the application to 
retrieve messages from the locking system software.</p>
