	<a href="mailto:user@emailserver.domain">user@emailserver.domain</a> </li>

	seperating them with a semicolon.</li>
	<li>Choose a subject.</li>
	<li>Specify the message that should be send to all reciepents. You could 
	make use of placeholders that will be replaced in the following manner:<br />
	<br />
	You could use the following placeholders: <br />
	'$lockname' = will be replaced by the name of the lock on which the event 
	has been arised<br />
	'$lockphi' = ... by the serialnumber (phi) of the lock ...<br />
	'$transpondername' = ... by the name of the transponder owner ...<br />
	'$transponderphi' = ... and its phi ...<br />
	'$datetime' = ... by the time, the event has been received from the 
	EventMessenger<br />

	granted)<br />
	<br />
	If you leave this blank, a default Message weill be send in english.<br />
	<br />
	BE AWARE: Availability of placeholders is bound to the event type. A 
	doormonitoring event for example doesnt know anything about the transponder 
	owner. With that said, $transpondername and $transponderphi will be replaced 
	with "$dontcare" if used in an doormonitoring event.</li>
