<h1>Create Events - Unlocking Events</h1>
<p>
<img alt="" src="imgE.jpg" /></p>
<p>In order to trigger an unlocking event, the EventMessenger software needs the 
name and serial number informations from the set of transponder and added lock(s) pairs 
that has fired the unlocking event along with the desired type of result (access 
granted, access denied or both).&nbsp; <br />
<br />
The check will always be performed per each transponder. With that said, one 
will always add one transponder with its name and/or serial number (phi) and one 
or more locks added to it.<br />
<br />
Please follow these steps to create such setup:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Please start by adding one lock.<ol>
		<li>Check the "consider lock name and/or phi" option if you do not want 
		to be informed about every lock in the locking system but one or more 
		specific one(s).</li>
		<li>Define a name and phi for each lock you would like to add.<br />
		<br />
		HINT:<br />
		- your input is treated as case insensitive and as a part of a whole 
		search phrase<br />
		<br />
		Example:<br />
		If you have entered "entrance" as the name of the lock all of the 
		following locknames will return a positive match:<br />
		"main entrance"; "Entrance North"</li>
		<li>Click on "Add" to add the lock with its name and phi (if defined 
		any).</li>
		<li>Continue to add locks as needed.</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
	<li>Define the name of the transponder owner and the phi of his/her transponder. 
	See hint under 1.2 about how the check is performed.<br />
	<br />
	Keep in mind, that you could add more than one transponder at once by 
	seperating the search phrases with a semicolon.<br /><br />Example:<br />If 
	you would like to check for Mrs. little and Mr. GIANT you could enter 
	"little; giant" as search phrase wich will return the desired result.<br />
	Please be aware to specify the phi among the transpondername in order to 
	prevent false-positive results when more than one "little" - phrase exists 
	in the locking system.</li>
	<li>Selecting the "Access Type" could be used to only trigger if the 
	transponder button press resulted in an "access granted" or "access denied". 
	Surely you could select "Trigger Both" if wanted.</li>
	<li>"Apply and Exit" will add the set of transponder and attached locks and 
	finish the unlocking event configuration for one transponder.</li>
</ol>
